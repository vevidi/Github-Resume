# Github Resume
- Please implement a Javascript one-page-application that lets users build
  a github resumé similiar to http://resume.github.io/
- Create a landing page where the user can enter his or her github
  account
- Implement a “generate button” on the landing page that starts
  processing the previously entered account name and shows a result view
  to the user (the generated resumé)
- The result view shows a summary showing which programming
  languages the github account owner has used in his/her repositorys (with
  percentage). That is sufficient. Feel free to add more statistics or to
  aggregate more data if you wish to.
- Implement a model that connects the data to the given HTML / Javascript
  template.
- Make sure to use the github API, please don't start parsing web pages
  manually
